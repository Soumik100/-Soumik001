"""Using 'exor' function because it gives output "0" for same input values (0 0 and 1 1) and output 1 for different input values (0 1 and 1 0)
Therefore, in two numbers, when we'll have different values at a bit, we will get 1 and we will need to replace that bit in the original number to make the numbers same
We will count the number of 1 s that come in binary after 'exor' operation to check how many bits we need to flip to convert 'a' to 'b' as asked in question
